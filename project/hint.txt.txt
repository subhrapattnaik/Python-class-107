
1. Import pandas library in code. (Make sure pandas is pre-installed using pip3 install
pandas earlier)
2. Import the plotly.express (Make sure plotly is pre-installed using pip3 install plotly )
3. Write code to read the csv data using pandas
4. Write code to find the mean of the attempts of each student in each level
5. create the Scatter graph figure using plotly.express
a) Pass the mean as first parameter and then pass the x and y coordinate values
b) Also Pass the size and color of each Scatter on the basis of attempt
c) Store the output in variable and using show ( ) method plot the graph











Hint : - While finding the mean of the attempt set the as_index = False to convert series
of the data to dataframe
Note - When you find the mean of attempts using groupby method, it gives you a
series instead of a dataframe. A series is like a list while a dataframe is like a list of lists.
In order to plot the graph, we will create a new dataframe using groupby and mean
methods, and we'll use the hint given above. We will use the resulting dataframe to plot
the graph.
